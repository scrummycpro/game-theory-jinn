Strategy: ALLCorALLD
Description: This strategy is at the parameter extreme of the ZD strategies (phi = 0).
    It simply repeats its last move, and so mimics ALLC or ALLD after round one.
    If the tournament is noisy, there will be long runs of C and D.

    For now starting choice is random of 0.6, but that was an arbitrary choice
    at implementation time.
